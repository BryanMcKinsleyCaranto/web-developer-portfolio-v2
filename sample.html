		<h3>Junior Full-stack Developer</h3>
		<p>When I graduated in college, I have chosen a different career path. After few years, I decided to pursue the career that I prefer. In order to achieve that goal, I recently completed a Coding bootcamp for Full-stack web development. As a career shifter, I am fully aware that I need to catch up on the modern practice in programming. Therefore, during my free time, I normally create simple applications to further improve my skills in programming. </p>

				<h4>E-Commerce Full Stack Web Development</h4>
				<p>This is the full-stack of my e-commerce project. The tools that was used for this project is React.js to make the display more dynamic. In this project, the user should be able to interact with the application by clicking the buttons and links accordingly. This project was deployed via this link https://capstone3-sandy-nine.vercel.app/.</p>

				<h4>E-Commerce Backend</h4>
				<p>This is the backend of my e-commerce project. In this project, I have used mongoDB as my open source database management. Other tools that I have used is JavaScript, node.js and express.js. In this project, a registration feature is available and there are two types of users which is the admin and regular user. I was able to separate the access of the two users by using the jsonwebtoken authentication. I also used Models, Controllers and Routes in order to manage my project effectively. In this project, the regular user should be able to login, browse available products, create an order or add the selected product to their cart and view order history. As for the admin, they are able to change another user to an admin, change the product information and view all order history.</p>
